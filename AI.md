# Intro
Hello there! I am using GitHub CoPilot for my individual project.
Will update this AI.md file soon!

### Update (21/8/2024):
GitHub copilot helped a lot with autocomplete and suggestions.
It was spot on except for a few things such as the scanner and my personalised messages.
Overall I would say it cut time for me but I could still just hardcode everything by myself.
